title: A Small Circle Finds Its Pulse
summary: >
  A new working group rediscovers energy and trust by making space for a
  simple pulse ritual at the beginning of their meetings.
body: >
  The new circle had a clear mandate and a daunting backlog. Every meeting
  began with a rush into tasks, metrics, and deadlines. Within weeks, people
  were showing up late or skipping entirely.

  One steward proposed a simple experiment: dedicate the first ten minutes
  of each gathering to check-ins and sensing the pulse of the circle. No
  problem-solving. No wordsmithing. Just presence.

  At first, it felt awkward. Over time, it became the most valued part of
  the meeting, revealing tensions, patterns of overwhelm, and unexpected
  sources of energy.

  - pulse-of-the-circle
