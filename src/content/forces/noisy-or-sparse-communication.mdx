title: Noisy or Sparse Communication
description: >
  Communication channels can be noisy or sparse, obscuring relevant signals—
  making it hard to distinguish important updates from background chatter.
categories:
  - communication
  - attention

Information flows can fail in two directions: too much noise drowns out signal,
while too little information leaves people guessing. Both extremes undermine
the shared awareness that self-synchronization requires.
