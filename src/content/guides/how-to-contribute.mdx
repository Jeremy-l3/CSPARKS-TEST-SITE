# How to Contribute

CSparks grows through the contributions of practitioners who share what they are learning. This guide outlines the pathways for contributing.

## Contribution Philosophy

Learning precedes contribution. Before adding to the library, we encourage you to:

- Explore existing patterns and forces
- Read how patterns are structured
- Notice how forces and patterns relate
- See how stories ground abstract ideas in practice

## Contribution Pathways

### Share a Story

Stories are often the easiest entry point. If you have experience with collaboration patterns in practice, consider documenting what happened.

### Propose a Force

Have you noticed a recurring tension or dynamic in collaborative work? Forces are discovered through careful observation.

### Suggest a Pattern

Patterns require the most structured documentation. They should respond to identified forces and be grounded in real practice.

### Improve Existing Content

Refinement and clarification of existing patterns, forces, and stories is valuable contribution.
