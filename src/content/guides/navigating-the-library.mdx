# Navigating the Library

The CSparks library is designed for exploration rather than consumption. There is no single correct path through the content.

## Content Types

### Patterns

Patterns describe practical solutions to recurring problems in collaborative life. Each pattern includes:

- **Context**: When this pattern applies
- **Problem**: The challenge it addresses
- **Forces**: The underlying tensions it navigates
- **Solution**: The core move
- **Implementation**: How to apply it

### Forces

Forces are the persistent tensions and dynamics that shape collaborative systems. They are not problems to solve, but conditions to navigate. Patterns work *with* forces rather than against them.

### Stories

Stories show patterns and forces in action. They provide human texture and context that pure pattern descriptions cannot capture.

## Following Connections

Content in the library is cross-linked:

- Patterns reference the forces they respond to
- Stories reference patterns and forces they illustrate
- Guides point to relevant patterns and forces

You can follow these connections to explore related ideas.

## Pattern Families

Patterns are grouped into families based on their domain or source tradition. This helps you find clusters of related patterns.
