# What is Collaborative Sparks?

Collaborative Sparks (CSparks) is a living pattern library for healthy collaboration. It collects patterns, forces, and stories emerging from real practice in regenerative communities, DAOs, cooperatives, and impact networks.

## What Lives Here

The library is organized around five interconnected content types:

- **Patterns** describe reusable solutions to recurring challenges in collaborative life
- **Forces** name the persistent tensions and dynamics that patterns must navigate
- **Stories** show how patterns and forces play out in real situations
- **Guides** (like this one) help you orient and navigate
- **References** ground the library in broader lineages and theory

## How to Engage

There is no required path through the library. You might:

- Browse patterns to discover practices that resonate
- Explore forces to understand the tensions that shape collaboration
- Read stories to see how others have navigated similar challenges
- Simply wander and see what catches your attention

The library is designed so you can *wander, orient, and return*.

## A Living Library

This is not a finished reference. Patterns evolve, new forces are discovered, stories accumulate. The library grows through the contributions of practitioners who share what they are learning.
