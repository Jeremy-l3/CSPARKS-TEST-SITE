## Context

In decentralized systems such as sociocratic organizations, communities of practice, or distributed networks, power and decision-making are shared across many roles and individuals. These systems rely not just on action or engagement, but on a deeper layer of **participation**—the way individuals show up, relate, and attune to collective processes.

## Problem / Tension

When participation is left undefined or assumed, people enter into decentralized spaces with varying and often conflicting expectations. This leads to:

- **Uneven presence and voice**—some people dominate, while others fade into the background
- **Unspoken assumptions** about who should contribute and when, which create misunderstandings and unmet needs
- **Confusion or frustration** when people "show up" but don't know how to participate meaningfully
- **Decisions and processes** that feel hollow or exclusive, despite being structurally open

In these cases, decentralization alone is not enough; **shared meaning around participation is missing**.

## Forces at Play

- **Different Participation Expectations**: People bring different experiences of leadership, hierarchy, and inclusion into new systems
- **Participation Shaped by Dynamics**: Participation is shaped by cultural, emotional, and psychological dynamics—not just structure
- **Defaults to Old Habits**: Without clear expectations, people default to old habits or withdraw entirely
- **Structure vs. Emergence Tension**: Too much structure can stifle emergence; too little can create ambiguity and disengagement
- **Presence Is Hard to Measure**: Presence, attention, and relational commitment are hard to measure but essential to collective intelligence

## Solution

**Cultivate collaborative participation by making participation itself a conscious, co-created practice—not just an implicit condition.**

This involves:

- **Surfacing and naming assumptions** about what it means to participate in this system
- **Inviting reflection and clarity**: Why am I here? What am I being asked to hold, not just do?
- **Establishing shared agreements** around presence, attention, voice, and availability
- **Making space for multiple modes of participation**—including listening, sensing, documenting, questioning, and supporting
- **Regularly reviewing and evolving participation norms**, especially as the system grows or changes

Participation becomes less about just _doing_, and more about _being in relationship_ with others, the work, and the system as a whole.

## Implementation

- Open conversations about participation expectations early in team formation
- Create explicit agreements about presence, voice, and availability
- Honor multiple modes of contribution beyond speaking
- Review participation norms periodically, especially after changes
- Model reflective participation from leadership

## Examples

- A circle that opens with "how do you want to participate today?" rounds
- A team with explicit norms about video-on/off, async participation, and speaking order
- An organization that values listening and sensing as much as proposing and deciding

## Failure Modes

- **Assumed participation**: Expecting everyone to participate the same way without discussion
- **Participation policing**: Making norms feel coercive rather than supportive
- **Voice dominance**: Overvaluing verbal contribution at expense of other modes
- **Static norms**: Participation agreements that don't evolve with the group

## Recognition

You'll know it's working when:

- People understand how they are expected—and invited—to show up
- Contributions become more thoughtful, inclusive, and aligned with shared purpose
- Diversity of thought and style is welcomed without sacrificing coherence
- The system becomes resilient and adaptive, rooted in **presence and mutual responsibility**, not just permissions and roles
