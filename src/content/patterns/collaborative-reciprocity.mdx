## Context

In decentralized and self-organizing systems—such as sociocratic circles, co-ops, or distributed teams—relationships and dependencies emerge organically. These relationships are the connective tissue of the system, enabling coordination, feedback, and shared purpose.

## Problem / Tension

When the **flow of energy, attention, or resources** between people or roles becomes unbalanced, the system suffers. This happens when:

- One party consistently **gives more than it receives**—leading to burnout, resentment, or detachment
- Others **expect support or response**, but don't contribute in return—leading to stagnation or exploitation
- The system's **natural interdependencies** are ignored or overridden by abstract rules or assumptions
- Reciprocity is **assumed**, rather than **consciously practiced**, leading to hidden tensions and unmet needs

Without reciprocal flow, decentralized systems become either **extractive**, **fragile**, or **disconnected**.

## Forces at Play

- **Relationships Require Mutual Nourishment**: Healthy relationships require mutual nourishment, not just contribution
- **Different Capacities and Rhythms**: People have different capacities, rhythms, and needs at different times
- **Reciprocity Not Symmetry**: Reciprocity does not mean symmetry; it means natural balance
- **Energy Needs to Flow Freely**: Systems function best when energy can move freely, without guilt, obligation, or dependency traps
- **Collaboration Without Reciprocity Creates Hierarchy**: Collaboration without reciprocity creates invisible hierarchies and erodes long-term trust

## Solution

**Cultivate collaborative reciprocity by creating conditions where energy, care, and contribution flow mutually and proportionally between roles, individuals, and circles.**

This involves:

- **Attuning to the relational field**: noticing where over-efforting or under-connection is happening
- **Designing roles, agreements, and rituals** that include feedback and appreciation loops
- **Naming and negotiating needs** openly, so over-extension or silence don't erode connection
- Encouraging people to ask: _What do I receive from this relationship? What do I give? Is there balance here?_
- Holding a cultural norm of **mutual responsibility**, not transactional exchange

Reciprocity isn't about keeping score—it's about **sustaining flow and honoring interdependence**.

## Implementation

- Build appreciation and feedback loops into regular rhythms
- Create space for honest conversations about capacity and needs
- Design roles with attention to what flows in and out
- Notice and name patterns of over-giving or under-contributing
- Celebrate mutual support as a cultural value

## Examples

- A team that includes "what do you need from us?" in regular check-ins
- A circle with explicit norms about responding to requests within a timeframe
- A partnership that periodically reviews "how are we each showing up for the other?"

## Failure Modes

- **Transactional scorekeeping**: Turning reciprocity into tit-for-tat
- **Martyrdom patterns**: Celebrating over-giving rather than addressing imbalance
- **Invisible labor**: Some contributions (often relational) going unrecognized
- **Guilt-based giving**: Contributing out of obligation rather than generosity

## Recognition

You'll know it's working when:

- Relationships feel **energizing rather than draining**
- Feedback, care, and support move in **two directions**, strengthening connection
- Contributions are made in a **sustainable and life-giving** way
- The system becomes more **resilient, adaptive, and whole**, as interdependence is honored and renewed
