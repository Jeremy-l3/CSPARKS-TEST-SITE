title: Pulse of the Circle
context: >
  In ongoing collaborations, circles meet regularly to synchronize, share
  updates, and make decisions. These meetings can drift toward status
  reporting and abstract debates, losing the living pulse of the circle.
problem: >
  When meetings prioritize abstract performance metrics over lived experience,
  people disconnect, burnout rises, and important signals are missed.
forces:
  - presence-before-performance
solution: >
  Establish a recurring pattern of "pulse" time in every gathering where
  participants briefly check in from their lived reality, name tensions,
  and sense the shared energy before moving into coordination or decision-making.
implementation: >
  Reserve time at the beginning of each meeting for check-ins and sensing.
  Keep this time bounded, but non-negotiable. Capture tensions that arise,
  then decide explicitly which ones will be processed now versus later.
examples:
  - 'A circle that begins each meeting with a 10-minute check-in round.'

  narrative: >
    This pattern crystallizes from years of practice in circles that hold
    presence, not just performance, as a key indicator of health.
