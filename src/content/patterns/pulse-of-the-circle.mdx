    This pattern crystallizes from years of practice in circles that hold
    presence, not just performance, as a key indicator of health.

## Context

In ongoing collaborations, circles meet regularly to synchronize, share updates, and make decisions. These meetings can drift toward status reporting and abstract debates, losing the living pulse of the circle.

## Problem / Tension

When meetings prioritize abstract performance metrics over lived experience, people disconnect, burnout rises, and important signals are missed. The group loses touch with what's actually alive in the space.

## Forces at Play

- **Presence Before Performance**: The pressure to "get things done" can override the need to first sense what's actually present in the room.
- **Urgency vs. Depth**: Time constraints push groups toward efficiency at the cost of connection.
- **Individual experience vs. collective narrative**: Without explicit space, personal tensions stay hidden.

## Solution

Establish a recurring pattern of "pulse" time in every gathering where participants briefly check in from their lived reality, name tensions, and sense the shared energy before moving into coordination or decision-making.

## Implementation

- Reserve time at the beginning of each meeting for check-ins and sensing
- Keep this time bounded, but non-negotiable
- Capture tensions that arise, then decide explicitly which ones will be processed now versus later
- Use simple prompts: "What's alive for you?" or "What do you bring into this space?"

## Examples

- A circle that begins each meeting with a 10-minute check-in round
- A team that uses a quick "weather report" (sunny, cloudy, stormy) before diving into agenda
- A governance meeting that starts with tension harvesting before proposal review

## Failure Modes

- **Pulse becomes performative**: Check-ins turn into status updates or impression management
- **Time creep**: Unbounded pulse time consumes the whole meeting
- **Bypassing**: Leaders skip pulse "just this once" when time is short, eroding the practice

## Recognition

You'll know it's working when:
- People share things they wouldn't have mentioned otherwise
- The group catches issues early before they become crises
- Meeting energy shifts noticeably after pulse time
- Participants look forward to this part of the gathering
