## Context

In decentralized or sociocratic systems, authority and agreements emerge from peer-to-peer relationships. There is no external enforcer; instead, agreements rely on mutual understanding, consent, and ongoing stewardship by those involved.

## Problem / Tension

When conflicts or misunderstandings arise around shared agreements, participants often revert to:

- Defending their **personal interpretation** of the agreement
- Viewing the other party as **misaligned** or acting in bad faith
- Retreating into **silence or withdrawal** to avoid confrontation
- Trying to resolve conflict through **dominance, avoidance, or escalation**

These reactions fracture the relational space in which the agreement exists. In the absence of centralized authority, such breakdowns erode trust and make future collaboration fragile.

## Forces at Play

- **Agreements Become Contested**: Decentralized systems require shared agreements, but these can become ambiguous or contested over time
- **Different Lenses and Assumptions**: People come with different lenses, cultural assumptions, and emotional responses
- **Agreements Evolve with Context**: Agreements are not static; they evolve as contexts shift and understanding deepens
- **Tension Becomes Personalized**: Without a mediating structure, tension becomes personalized and hard to resolve
- **Repair Requires Reinterpretation**: The health of the system depends on the ability to repair and reinterpret together, not avoid or dominate

## Solution

**Practice collaborative mediation, recognizing that agreements live in the liminal space between people and must be co-held, co-tended, and re-aligned when tension arises.**

This involves:

- Treating the agreement not as _mine_ or _yours_, but as **ours**—suspended in the relational field
- Naming and exploring the **tension without assigning blame**
- Bringing curiosity and presence to the **meaning and purpose** of the agreement
- Inviting a third-party mediator when needed—not to decide, but to hold space for re-understanding
- Encouraging **co-ownership of the repair** process

## Implementation

- Build shared language around "our agreement" rather than "your commitment"
- Create structures for revisiting and re-consenting to agreements
- Train facilitation skills for holding tension without forcing resolution
- Establish norms for inviting neutral third parties when needed
- Practice naming tensions early before they calcify into positions

## Examples

- A circle that revisits agreements quarterly to check for drift or changing needs
- A partnership that uses a neutral facilitator to explore disagreement without blame
- A team that frames conflict as "our agreement needs attention" rather than "you broke your promise"

## Failure Modes

- **Avoiding mediation**: Letting tensions fester rather than addressing them
- **Forced resolution**: Pushing for agreement before understanding is reached
- **Blame orientation**: Making mediation about determining fault
- **Over-reliance on mediators**: Not building capacity for peer-to-peer repair

## Recognition

You'll know it's working when:

- Disagreements about agreements become opportunities for deepening understanding
- People approach tension with curiosity rather than defensiveness
- Agreements feel alive and adaptable, not rigid contracts
- Trust increases through successful navigation of conflict
- The relational field strengthens rather than frays under pressure
