## Context

In complex networks—particularly those involving people, power, and relationships—the idea of observer and observed, actor and environment, quickly breaks down. The longer we engage, the more evident it becomes that we are not outside the network. We are **of** it.

## Problem / Tension

When we operate from a position of separation—treating the network as an external object—we risk:

- Creating interventions that are **disconnected from lived dynamics**
- Ignoring how our presence, assumptions, and methods **shape the very behaviors** we observe
- Maintaining illusions of control or neutrality that limit systemic insight
- Failing to see how our own identities, histories, and roles **entangle with outcomes**
- Reinforcing boundaries between "us" and "them," designer and designed, which the network does not recognize

This false distance reduces networks to techniques, and blocks the kind of **deep participation** required for transformation.

## Forces at Play

- **Traditional Approaches Reward Detachment**: Traditional approaches reward objectivity, expertise, and detachment
- **Reflexivity Requires Vulnerability**: Reflexivity requires vulnerability and humility—traits not always valued or easy to embody
- **Entanglement Complicates Agency**: Entanglement complicates agency: we are never fully in control, nor entirely passive
- **Easier to Analyze Than Acknowledge**: It is easier to analyze a network than to acknowledge how we are part of it

## Solution

**Acknowledge your entanglement. Recognize that you are not external to the network, but co-emerging with it. Practice reflexivity, humility, and responsibility for the dynamics you participate in and shape.**

This includes:

- Asking reflexive questions like: _How am I shaping what I'm trying to understand?_ and _What is this network revealing about me?_
- Letting go of the idea of neutral observation or detached action
- Embracing Karen Barad's concept of **intra-action**—where parts of a system co-constitute one another, rather than act independently
- Understanding agency as **emergent and relational**, not individually held
- Allowing yourself to be **changed by the work**—ethically, emotionally, materially
- Centering **responsibility**, not for fixing the network, but for being accountable to the **relational becoming** you are part of

Entanglement is not a limitation. It's the deep ground from which meaningful, ethical network practice grows.

## Implementation

- Build reflexive questions into regular practice
- Share how you've been changed by the work, not just what you've observed
- Name your positionality and how it shapes your perspective
- Create space for the network to "speak back" to your assumptions
- Practice accountability to relationships, not just outcomes

## Examples

- A researcher who includes their own journey of understanding in their findings
- A consultant who names how their presence changed group dynamics
- A team that regularly asks "what is this work revealing about us?"

## Failure Modes

- **Excessive navel-gazing**: Reflexivity that becomes self-absorption
- **Paralysis through complexity**: Using entanglement as an excuse for inaction
- **Performative humility**: Claiming entanglement while still acting from a distance
- **Losing all ground**: Dissolving into relativism without any actionable perspective

## Recognition

You'll know it's working when:

- Practitioners develop **deep self-awareness** alongside systemic insight
- Networks become **ethically rooted**, not just technically competent
- Interventions become more **responsive, relational, and grounded** in lived realities
- Trust, responsibility, and co-creation emerge through **shared becoming**
- The boundary between "network" and "self" dissolves—replaced by a **web of mutual shaping**
