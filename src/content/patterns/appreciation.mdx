## Context

In diverse networks, coalitions, or teams—particularly those working across lines of identity, geography, or discipline—**participants bring different histories, worldviews, and ways of contributing**. The vitality of a network often depends on its ability to bridge these differences and cultivate the unique gifts of its members.

However, when dominant cultural norms are left unexamined, they can **invisibly shape whose contributions are valued**, whose presence is normalized, and who feels safe enough to show up fully.

## Problem / Tension

When appreciation is not intentionally practiced:

- Contributions that don't fit the dominant mold are **overlooked or subtly devalued**
- Participants feel pressure to **conform or perform** in ways that mask their identities and dampen their strengths
- The culture becomes **transactional or extractive**, focused on utility rather than mutual regard
- Trust withers, especially across lines of difference
- The network **misses out on the creativity, connection, and resilience** that emerge from real diversity

In the absence of appreciation, diversity becomes a risk instead of a strength.

## Forces at Play

- **Unconscious Dominant Norms**: Dominant cultural norms (e.g., professionalism, productivity-centered mindsets) often operate unconsciously, setting the baseline for what's seen as "normal" or "effective"
- **Marginalized Identity Burden**: People from marginalized identities may already carry risk, trauma, or exhaustion into the space
- **Appreciation vs. Tokenism**: Genuine appreciation can be confused with flattery, tokenism, or sentimentality
- **Urgency Crowds Out Presence**: Structures of hierarchy or urgency can crowd out space for slowness, recognition, and relationality

## Solution

**Practice appreciation deliberately and consistently**—not as a performance, but as an ethic.

This means:

- **Accept people as they are**, without requiring assimilation
- **Acknowledge and elevate diverse ways of knowing, relating, and creating**—including nonverbal, intuitive, emotional, ancestral, or place-based forms
- **Decenter dominant norms** (e.g. whiteness, formality, urgency) to make room for pluralism
- **Create space for public expressions of gratitude and recognition**—not only at the end of events, but as part of the daily life of the network
- Ask regularly: *Who or what are you appreciating right now?*
- Make room for mutual appreciation that is **specific, genuine, and affirming**, even in moments of difficulty

In doing so, appreciation becomes a social nutrient—a way to reinforce **relational trust**, support **reciprocity**, and invite the full presence of each person.

## Implementation

- Build appreciation into meeting rhythms (opening or closing rounds)
- Create explicit practices for naming contributions that might otherwise go unseen
- Regularly ask: "Whose voice haven't we heard? What perspective are we missing?"
- Celebrate different forms of contribution, not just deliverables
- Model appreciation from leadership without making it performative

## Examples

- A network that begins each gathering with a round of specific appreciations
- A team that rotates "appreciation notes" to recognize behind-the-scenes work
- A coalition that explicitly names and values indigenous or ancestral knowledge alongside academic expertise

## Failure Modes

- **Performative appreciation**: Appreciation becomes a ritual without genuine feeling
- **Appreciation as avoidance**: Using positivity to bypass necessary conflict or critique
- **Unequal distribution**: Only certain people or types of work get appreciated
- **Tokenism trap**: Appreciation for marginalized voices becomes a way to check a box without sharing power

## Recognition

You'll know it's working when:
- People feel **seen, respected, and free to contribute their full selves**
- The group becomes more **relationally resilient**, able to navigate disagreement without eroding trust
- Contributions multiply in both number and diversity
- Trust builds not just between individuals, but within the culture itself
- People start appreciating each other without prompting
