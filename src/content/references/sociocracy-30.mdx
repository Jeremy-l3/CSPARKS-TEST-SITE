# Sociocracy 3.0

Sociocracy 3.0 (S3) is an open framework of patterns for effective collaboration and governance. It provides a comprehensive pattern library for organizations seeking to distribute authority and enable self-organization.

## Core Principles

S3 is built on seven principles:

1. **Effectiveness** - Devote time only to what brings you closer to achieving objectives
2. **Consent** - Raise, seek out, and resolve objections to proposals and existing agreements
3. **Empiricism** - Test all assumptions through experiments and continuous revision
4. **Continuous Improvement** - Regularly review the outcome of what you are doing
5. **Equivalence** - Involve people in making and evolving decisions that affect them
6. **Transparency** - Record all information that is valuable for the organization
7. **Accountability** - Respond when something is needed

## Influence on CSparks

Many patterns in CSparks draw from or relate to S3 patterns, particularly in the areas of:

- Governance and decision-making
- Circle-based organization
- Roles and accountability
- Consent-based processes

## Pattern Families

S3 organizes its patterns into families including:

- Sense-Making and Decision-Making
- Evolving Organizations
- Peer Development
- Organizational Structure
- Meeting Practices
